# Robotic Arm 5 DOF

**3D design of a 5 DOF robotic arm for educational and prototyping purposes**

## Project Description
This project is a 3D design of a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). The arm is designed to demonstrate rotational and linear movements through multiple joints, allowing flexible motion and precise control.

## Features
- 3D robotic arm model.
- Five degrees of freedom:
  1. Base rotation.
  2. Shoulder joint movement.
  3. Elbow joint movement.
  4. Wrist joint movement.
  5. Gripper open and close.

## Tools Used
- Tinkercad

## How It Works
Each joint of the robotic arm is designed to allow a specific type of movement:
- The base provides rotational movement.
- The shoulder, elbow, and wrist provide vertical and horizontal motion.
- The gripper allows object manipulation by opening and closing.

## Applications
- Robotics education.
- Prototyping robotic movements.
- Demonstrating basic robotic kinematics.
