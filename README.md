# RoboticArm-5-DOF
3D design of a 5 DOF robotic arm for educational and prototyping purposes
Project Description
This project is a 3D design of a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). The arm is designed to demonstrate rotational and linear movements through multiple joints, allowing flexible motion and precise control.

Features
3D robotic arm model.
Five degrees of freedom:
Base rotation.
Shoulder joint movement.
Elbow joint movement.
Wrist joint movement.
Gripper open and close.

Tools Used
Tinkercad

How It Works

Each joint of the robotic arm is designed to allow a specific type of movement:
The base provides rotational movement.
The shoulder, elbow, and wrist provide vertical and horizontal motion.
The gripper allows object manipulation by opening and closing.

Applications

Robotics education.
Prototyping robotic movements.
Demonstrating basic robotic kinematics.
